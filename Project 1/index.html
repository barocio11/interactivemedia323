    <br>
    <p>For this Project I used a article written by the Late Henry Flynt. Henry Flynt was a philosopher who wrote an essay about the distinction between Art and Brend. From reading the article I starting understanding it as a critique, more than a article. My platform was Craigslist and I decided on it because I wanted to challenge the platform and use it in a different way. From that point I decided to create a job listing as Henry Flynt. Since the article involved a section about the distinction between Art and Science, It was decided to relate to that section. The ad depicts Henry Flynt as a Science Major and Minor looking for a job in Art critique. It describes him as a candidate that could be taken seriously because of his views on art. I personified the article to give it life, and created a persona out of the author.</p>
