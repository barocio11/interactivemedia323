<body>
<div>Happy as something unimportant <br>   
and free as a thing unimportant. <br>  
As something no one prizes <br>
and which does not prize itself. <br> 
As something mocked by all <br>
and which mocks at their mockery.  <br> 
As laughter without serious reason. <br>  
As a yell able to outyell itself. <br> 
Happy as no matter what, <br>
as any no matter what. <br>
<br>
Happy<br>
as a dogâ€™s tail.</div>
